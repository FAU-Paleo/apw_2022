# Snack phylogeny

In this exercise, we'll explore the process of building a phylogeny.

You have 7 snacks and your task is to build a **rooted tree**, assumming the snacks have a shared phylogenetic history, just like species.

How you do this is completely up to you and your group. It might help to start by choosing an outgroup and then considering what characters support the nodes in your phylogeny.

Write down your logic as you go along!
