## Snack phylogeny

In this exercise, we'll explore the impact of time on phylogeny.

Below are the trees you produced yesterday. Today you have some additional information about the *age* of each snack.

Discuss the following in your groups:
 * **Is your tree compatible with this information?**
 * **Do your need to make any changes to your tree?**

### Acknowledgements

This exercise is based on the one described [here](https://labroides.wordpress.com/candy-phylogeny/) by Josh Drew.
